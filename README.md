🔍 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection
Acquired a structured dataset in .CSV format containing customer transactions and purchase details.
2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values and inconsistencies
Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries
Converted data types for smooth analysis
Standardized categorical fields
3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized distributions using histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots
Explored relationships between key variables using correlation heatmaps
Identified outliers and anomalies
Extracted actionable business insights
📊 Key Insights
✔ Young Adults (25-35) demonstrate the highest purchase frequency
✔ Seasonal patterns significantly influence shopping behavior
✔ Subscription holders tend to spend more and purchase more frequently
✔ Discounts and promo codes positively impact purchase amounts
✔ Payment preferences vary by age group and location
